# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer üìä

An interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool allows users to visually explore how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process of an array of random values. The project is designed for educational purposes to help understand the mechanics behind various sorting algorithms.

## üß† Sorting Algorithms Explained

This visualizer includes nine different sorting algorithms, each with a unique approach to ordering data.

* **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The larger elements "bubble" to the end of the list.

* **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning. It maintains a sorted and an unsorted subarray.

* **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements and "inserts" each element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array, much like sorting a hand of playing cards.

* **Merge Sort**: A "divide and conquer" algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves back into one sorted array.

* **Quick Sort**: Also a "divide and conquer" algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot, placing smaller elements to its left and larger ones to its right. The subarrays are then sorted recursively.

* **Heap Sort**: This comparison-based algorithm uses a binary heap data structure. It first converts the array into a max-heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted portion of the array.

* **Count Sort**: A non-comparison sorting algorithm that is efficient for a limited range of integer inputs. It works by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element in the input array.

* **Radix Sort**: A non-comparison integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value.

* **Bucket Sort**: This algorithm works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of "buckets." Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Generate an Array**: Click the **"Generate New Array"** button to start with a new random set of bars.
2.  **Adjust Settings**: Use the **"Size"** and **"Speed"** sliders to configure the visualizer to your preference.
3.  **Select an Algorithm**: Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4.  **Start Sorting**: Click the **"Start"** button to begin the visualization.
5.  **Control Playback**: The button will change to **"Pause"** and **"Resume"**, allowing you to control the animation as it runs.
