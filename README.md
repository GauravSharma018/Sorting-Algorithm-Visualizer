# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool allows users to visually explore how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process of an array of random values. The project is designed for educational purposes to help understand the mechanics behind various sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose between popular sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.
- **Interactive Visualization**: See how the sorting algorithm operates in real-time, with bars representing array elements.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting process using a slider.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualizer is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into subarrays, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array, recursively sorting the subarrays.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Sorting Algorithm**: Use the dropdown menu to choose between **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.
2. **Generate a New Array**: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array to sort.
3. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to control the speed of the animation. The faster the slider is set, the faster the sorting will occur.
4. **Start Sorting**: Click the "Start Sorting" button to begin sorting the array using the selected algorithm. Watch the bars move as the algorithm sorts the array.
