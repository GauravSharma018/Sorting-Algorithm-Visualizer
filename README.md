# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is an interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visualize how various sorting algorithms work by animating the process of sorting an array of random values. Users can select from multiple sorting algorithms and generate new random arrays to sort.
